APE folder : https://github.com/Attempto/APE

Clex : https://github.com/Attempto/Clex

Mark ACE_to_DRS.sh as executable and you can run it as a shell script that reads the ACE_in.txt file and runs the APE software on it, then outputs the resulting DRS to DRS.txt (you'll need to run make install in the APE folder once to install it after adding Clex)
